HTML is the backbone of the web. Every web page, whether a simple document or a complex application, is built on it. When you open a browser, you are looking at HTML in action: it defines structure, meaning, and the hooks that connect to CSS, JavaScript, and APIs.

At first glance, HTML seems straightforward (just tags and attributes), but under the surface lies a detailed set of rules that browsers follow. These rules are codified in the **HTML Living Standard**, maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

## A living language

Unlike earlier specifications that were released in fixed versions (HTML4, XHTML, HTML5), the Living Standard is continuously updated. There is no "HTML6" waiting in the wings. Instead, the standard evolves gradually, reflecting the pace of change on the web itself. Features are added, revised, or marked obsolete as browsers converge on common behavior.

This approach acknowledges a truth: the web cannot stand still. A living one ensures that what is documented is what is implemented in practice.

The HTML specification is not only one text. The canonical version at [html.spec.whatwg.org](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) is written primarily for implementers: browser vendors and standards contributors. It contains every rule needed to parse markup, build DOM trees, and handle edge cases, right down to how invalid code should be corrected. For developers, there is also a **developer-friendly view** at [html.spec.whatwg.org/dev](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/), which trims some of the implementer-focused detail. Even so, it remains a specification, not a tutorial.

## Why this book exists

This book follows a simple philosophy: _"I read the spec so you don't have to."_

The HTML spec, in both implementer and developer editions, is rigorous and precise. That rigor makes it invaluable for browser engineers but challenging for practitioners who simply want to write correct, future-proof HTML. Developers looking for answers often end up wading through parsing algorithms or historical notes. These details do not directly help them.

This book reshapes the raw material of the specification into a guide for developers. It distills, organizes, and explains. The goal is not to replace the standard, but to make it accessible. Where the spec gives you the rule, this book explains the purpose. Where the spec outlines a parsing algorithm, this book shows the impact on your markup.

## A short history

HTML was born in 1991 when Tim Berners-Lee created a small set of tags to describe documents on the first web servers. In 1995, HTML 2.0 was published as the first formalized standard. Over the years, more versions followed, sometimes introducing improvements, sometimes breaking compatibility.

In the early 2000s, XHTML attempted to reshape HTML into strict XML. Adoption stalled. Developers and browsers alike found it unforgiving. At the same time, demand for richer web applications grew. The WHATWG formed in 2004 with the goal of extending HTML pragmatically, leading to HTML5, a standard that reconnected with real-world needs. From there, the Living Standard was born, with no more numbered versions.

That history matters because it explains HTML's unusual character: a mix of elegant principles and messy compromises. The language has to accommodate everything from modern single-page apps to decades-old documents still online. Understanding HTML deeply means understanding not just _how_ it works, but _why_ it works the way it does.

## Scope of this book

This book does not attempt to be a beginner's crash course. It is for developers who want to understand HTML thoroughly: every element, every attribute, every model of content.

Covered in detail:

- All standard elements and attributes in the Living Standard.
- Concepts such as parsing, the DOM, and content models.
- Key APIs where HTML defines hooks (forms, media, canvas, custom elements).
- Accessibility requirements that shape markup.
- Conformance rules that distinguish correct from incorrect usage.

Covered lightly or excluded:

- CSS and JavaScript in their full scope (addressed only when they intersect with HTML).
- Browser engine internals beyond what is necessary to explain element behavior.
- Non-standard features, deprecated quirks, and historical dead ends (mentioned only where context is useful).

Each chapter aims to balance theory with practice. You will see both what the spec mandates and how to apply that knowledge when building web pages and applications.

## Tools to work with HTML

The HTML spec is the authoritative source, but no developer works with the spec alone. Several tools and references are indispensable:

- **Validators and conformance checkers**: [The W3C Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) is the main tool to verify markup. It enforces conformance rules and flags errors or warnings.
- **Accessibility testing tools**: Automated checkers and manual audit frameworks (such as [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org)) reveal issues that affect users with disabilities. Accessibility is not optional; it is central to modern HTML.
- [**MDN Web Docs**](https://developer.mozilla.org): While the specification defines the rules, MDN offers approachable explanations, examples, and browser-compatibility data. It is the practical reference most developers use day to day.

These tools complement the material in this book. Where the book provides deep understanding, the tools provide immediate feedback and applied knowledge.

## Reading this book

The organization of this book mirrors the structure of the specification, but rephrased and contextualized for developers. You do not need to read the spec in parallel, though references are provided for those who want to verify or explore further.

The aim is to give you a clear mental model of the language. You will learn not just how to write correct markup, but how browsers interpret it, why certain rules exist, and how to make informed choices as a developer.

By the end, you will not only be able to write HTML that works, but also HTML that is robust, accessible, and future-proof.
